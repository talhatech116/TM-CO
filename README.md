## 📚 Case Study: Simplifying Property Ops for Multi-Facility Owners

### 🧩 The Problem
Owners of multiple facilities (hotels, gyms, camps) were overwhelmed with fragmented tools and manual processes. Maintenance tasks were often missed, check-ins were slow, and guests lacked a clear way to report issues.  

There was **no centralized platform** where owners could both **showcase their properties** and **streamline operational workflows**.

### 💡 The Solution
We built **TMCO** — a unified mobile app designed specifically for property managers and service teams.  

- Centralized listing of all facilities under one platform  
- Real-time maintenance request system connected directly to staff  
- Seamless guest check-in/check-out experience  
- Operational insights for owners to make data-driven decisions
